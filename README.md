This attendance register is so simple and dynamic that it can be suitable for any project seeking to record attendance. Indeed, it displays every day of this month, as well as employees or students, and you just have to check the corresponding box. matching the student or candidate once you're done, you just have to back up, that's all. If we are in December, every day in December, if you are in January, it will automatically go into January, and so on. I decided to share to make your system great and save time developing or searching for records.
